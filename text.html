			<strong>The Giant Squid</strong>                <!--Initial "Main" Heading-->
		</h1>
		<h2>- From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia -</h2>    <!--heading 2-->

		<p><!--1st paragraph-->The giant squid <b>(genus:<em> Architeuthis</em>)</b> is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species. 
		 Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size <em>(see Deep-sea gigantism):</em> recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m <em>(43 ft)</em> for females and 10 m <em>(33 ft)</em>
		 for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m<em>(46 ft)</em>, one of the largest living
		 organisms). The mantle is about 2 m <em>(6.6 ft)</em> long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m <em>(16 ft)</em>. Claims
		 of specimens measuring 20 m <em>(66 ft)</em> or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>
		 
		 <p><!--2nd paragraph-->On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <b>NMNS <em>(Museum of Nature and Science)</em></b>
		of Tokyo, Japan and the <b>OWA<em>(Ogasawara Whale Watching Association)</em></b> took the first images
		of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released
		a year later. The <b>NMNS</b> and <b>OWA</b> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time
		on 4 December 2006.   </p>
