/*Instructions 
This assignment will require that you have completed all the activities so far, as you will incorporate their objectives 
into a ongoing four-part project. Make sure to fix any errors from the previous project and continue to add to it for this assignment. 
Build Your Site 
You will be graded on your ability to demonstrate a proficiency in each of these concepts and you will see these reflected in the grading rubric provided. Below are the concepts broken down into the requirements for the project: 





	

o	Add a web based font using: 
•	<link /> or @font-face



o	Change the default list styling using: 
•	list-style-type
•	Box model 

o	The following CSS properties should be used: 
•	width
•	height
•	padding
•	border
•	margin



o	Change the display of elements from their default using: 
•	display
•	Comments 

o	Add comments to both your HTML and CSS to help with organization. For example, HTML 
comments where divs close ("end content") and CSS comments to 
split the stylesheet into different sections ("main styles", "navigation", "layout", etc.).

•	Validation 

o	Make sure both your HTML and CSS are valid using the W3C Validation Services.

Note: Use CSS shorthand wherever possible to make your code more efficient. See the resources for a great guide to shorthand properties. 

Check Your Page 

Open the web page in your browser to make sure that your page looks the way you expected and that both your HTML and CSS validates. If there are any problems go back and check for errors in your code.
